[This](https://hub.docker.com/r/yegor256/squid-proxy)
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
image helps you start your own [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/)
proxy server, with [HTTP Basic authorization][basic].
You may need this if you want your crawling/scaping software
to look like constantly going to the Network from the same IP address. You
rent a VPS, start a Squid server there and configure your software to
go everywhere through an explicit HTTP(S) proxy.

When Docker is [installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), run this:

```bash
$ docker run --name proxy --detach --restart=always --publish 8081:3128 \
  --env USERNAME=jeffrey --env PASSWORD=swordfish \
  yegor256/squid-proxy
```

Now you can connect to `localhost:8081` with `jeffrey:swordfish`
credentials. For example:

```bash
curl -vvv --proxy http://jeffrey:swordfish@0.0.0.0:8081 https://google.com/
```

Or, with [httpie](https://httpie.io/):

```shell
http --proxy=http:http://jeffrey:swordfish@0.0.0.0:8081 https://google.com/
```

BTW, the proxy is [anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer).
Once it's up and running, you can check whether it's visible,
using [this service](http://amibehindaproxy.com/).
It also doesn't store any logs and doesn't cache any content.

You can also use [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  proxy:
    image: yegor256/squid-proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8081:3128"
    environment:
      - USERNAME=jeffrey
      - PASSWORD=swordfish
```

## Developing

Build it locally:

```bash
docker build . -t squid-proxy:latest
```

Want to push to a local machine?

```bash
docker save squid-proxy | ssh -C your@machine docker load
```
